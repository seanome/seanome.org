## Our Why

Seanome builds open-source software to figure out how the genes of weird animals in the ocean can help us live longer, healthier, and more sustainable lives. 

### Mission

> Our mission is to unlock breakthroughs from ocean biodiversity by building open genomics tools


Biodiversity brought us breakthroughs like [Ozempic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide) (derived from [lizard venom)](https://medicine.uq.edu.au/article/2024/04/rise-ozempic-how-surprise-discoveries-and-lizard-venom-led-new-class-weight-loss-drugs) and [anti-HIV and anti-cancer compounds](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/sea-sponge-hiv-medicine) from a single innovative organism, [ancient sea sponges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectitethya_crypta), a tiny glimpse of what’s possible when we . These discoveries come from a handful of species representing a tiny fraction of Earth’s biodiversity. We’ve only begun to explore nature’s 4 billion years of experiments.

### Vision

> Our vision is to open-source the code of life, empowering humanity’s transformation to a world guided by nature's ancient wisdom

Imagine a world where we drive cars (maybe self-driving?) out of seashells, our homes are built from from tree- and coral-inspired materials filtering our air and water for us, and disease is eliminated because we know how nature has solved health. We see a future where given any problem, we ask, how has nature already solved this problem? How has nature already solved this disease? How has nature created strong materials that withstand the test of time and eliminate the need for landfills?

## Why the Ocean?

Home to 80% of animal life, the ocean is teeming with 

The ocean is home to animals with unique adaptations that can’t exist on land, and has given us one transformative technology — green fluorescent protein (GFP) from glowing jellyfish. Without GFP, we wouldn’t be able to develop COVID vaccines[4](https://blog.seanome.org/p/empower-the-forgotten-99-of-life#footnote-4-158383565) or create “[brainbows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainbow)” to study the connections of the brain’s [100 billion neurons](https://www.notion.so/7-Rob-K-Podcast-Appearance-1a82dc4932b880929a1fc4c8a7fea77f?pvs=21)[5](https://blog.seanome.org/p/empower-the-forgotten-99-of-life#footnote-5-158383565). A wealth of potential applications in human health and longevity swims in our seas. These include unfreezable fish whose [antifreeze proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifreeze_protein) could preserve organs indefinitely, [immortal jellyfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_dohrnii) whose reversal of aging could transform what we think of a “normal” lifespan, and Seanome’s pilot project on [Arctic clams](https://blog.seanome.org/p/curing-diseases-with-arctic-clams) whose neurotoxin tolerance could cure neurodegenerative disease.

The extraordinary biodiversity of marine animals — representing 76% of animal life[6](https://blog.seanome.org/p/empower-the-forgotten-99-of-life#footnote-6-158383565) and 43 billion[7](https://blog.seanome.org/p/empower-the-forgotten-99-of-life#footnote-7-158383565) genes[8](https://blog.seanome.org/p/empower-the-forgotten-99-of-life#footnote-8-158383565) — created fast-evolving immune systems to battle 100 million viruses per teaspoon of seawater[9](https://blog.seanome.org/p/empower-the-forgotten-99-of-life#footnote-9-158383565). This rich ecosystem is nature’s most diverse testing ground and offers a potential gold mine of novel therapeutics (including antivirals, antibiotics, antifungals) and an ideal environment for building better protein analysis tools. If we can decode the ocean’s molecular mysteries, we can understand anything.

## Why Ocean Animals?

Seanome is specifically focused on ocean *animals* (rather than microbes) because of the emergent properties appearing in complex organ systems. Where microbes are like single-family homes, animal bodies are like cities, requiring municipal-wide waste management (lymphatic system), communication mechanisms (nervous system), and defense (immune system). At Seanome, we are especially interested in the [neuroimmune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimmune_system) axis because of the interplay between our nervous system and immune response. By studying animals with vastly different body plans than ourselves (think octopi, jellyfish, clams), we can learn deep biological truths about disease manifestation.

### An untapped trillion-dollar frontier

43 billion animal genes swim in our oceans, yet we only understand what 8000 of them do. Of these, already 13 FDA-approved drugs worth $8.4B

## What we do

At Seanome, we build open-source software to annotate proteins of unknown function. As >>99% of proteins on the planet are of unknown function, we are solving a problem with immense potential to transform life as we know it.

### [Kmerseek](https://github.com/seanome/kmerseek/): A blazing-fast protein function predictor

Seanome's Kmerseek bridges the evolutionary gap between marine and human genomes. By creating an alternative biochemical latent space and speeding up computation ~1000x, Kmerseek finds similarities between proteins that other tools don't see.

### [nf-core/proteinannotator](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinannotator): The best protein annotation pipeline in the world

An astounding 14 quadrillion potential proteins exist in the world. Scientists have functionally annotated ~500,000 of those proteins in UniProtKB through exceptional manual effort. However, these annotations are biased toward well-studied organisms, undersampling billions of species. Manual curation cannot realistically annotate all proteins on the scale of the Earth, and at Seanome, our vision is to create the best protein annotator for any organism. As no tool will perfectly annotate all proteins, we’re building the nf-core/proteinannotator pipeline as a “wisdom of crowds” approach across methods like DIAMOND-blastp, InterProScan, HMMer, FoldSeek, and emerging tools like Kmerseek. This work aims to support the broader scientific community's efforts to catalog and understand global biodiversity through large-scale sequencing projects.

### Initial Application: Arctic Clams

[Arctic clams](https://blog.seanome.org/p/curing-diseases-with-arctic-clams) have already solved multiple human problems: they can live for 100s of years, regenerate their shells (if we could regenerate our skulls and spine like clams, we could add 5-15 years of healthy human life), and outsmarted a chronic nerve pain disease (neuropathy) affecting ~20 million people in the US+EU, a $93.9B/yr market.

## Future Applications

### Health

The next cure for cancer is swimming in the ocean — where we've explored less than 1% of species for medicines, missing solutions like Arctic clams naturally tolerating neurotoxins causing human disease. Seanome unlocks nature’s 4 billion year old pharmacy, democratizing access and empowering scientists worldwide to accelerate the discovery of breakthrough therapies for cancer, neurodegeneration, antibiotic resistance, and beyond.

### Longevity

The ocean harbors Earth’s longest-lived animals — from clams surviving over 500 years to jellyfish reversing aging to fish perfecting natural cryopreservation. Seanome decodes these time-defying adaptations, beginning with Arctic clams that naturally protect against neurotoxins, to transform marine wisdom into innovations for human healthspan.

### Synthetic Biology

The next CRISPR is swimming in the ocean, but we need the right tools to find it among the >99% of unexplored marine genes. Seanome is building open-source computational tools to unlock this molecular library, helping create a future without landfills, where cars are made from seashells and our homes are built from coral-inspired materials filtering our air and water.

### Climate

From scalding volcanic vents to freezing Arctic waters, ocean organisms have perfected life in Earth’s most extreme environments across 4 billion years of climate change. Seanome decodes these ancient survival mechanisms, transforming marine adaptations into innovations for a climate-resilient future.

### Biodiversity

The ocean gave birth to Earth’s most innovative body plans — from shapeshifting octopi to immortal jellyfish to ancient clams — solving 43 billion molecular problems, yet we only understand 8,000 of these breakthroughs. Seanome builds open-source tools to decode these vast libraries of untapped innovation, transforming marine life's most radical experiments into democratized knowledge that can revolutionize medicine, materials, and our understanding of life itself.
