# Seanome: Unlocking the Ocean's Genetic Code

## Who We Are

Seanome is a community-focused research organization building scalable, open-source tools to decode the vast genetic potential of our oceans. Founded by computational biologist Dr. Olga Botvinnik, we are revolutionizing how scientists understand and harness marine biodiversity.

## Our Mission

We build open tools to characterize the "forgotten 99%" of marine genetic diversity, unlocking breakthrough discoveries that can heal, nourish, and renew life on Earth.

## Why the Ocean?

The ocean represents Earth's greatest untapped genetic repository:

- Home to 70% of all animal phyla, evolved over 4 billion years
- Contains extraordinary biodiversity with innovative body plans, immune systems, and molecular mechanisms
- Faces unprecedented evolutionary pressures (a single teaspoon of seawater harbors 100 million viruses!)
- Remains vastly unexplored, with up to 90% of ocean species still undescribed

## Our Approach

### Technical Innovation

We're developing computational frameworks that reveal hidden patterns in marine genomes where traditional tools reach their limits:

- Creating algorithms to identify functional relationships between proteins with low sequence similarity
- Building scalable, low-resource tools accessible to researchers worldwide
- Combining biochemical data augmentation with AI to characterize previously "unsolvable" protein sequences

### Open-Source Ecosystem

Our tools are developed in the open, using Nextflow, Python, and Rust to create software that empowers thousands of scientists worldwide:

- Open-source code repositories with active community engagement
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- Live-streamed scientific coding sessions to democratize technical knowledge

### Community Engagement

We believe in science that transcends traditional boundaries:

- Partnerships with Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities who have stewarded biodiversity for millennia
- Citizen science initiatives that expand participation in marine genomics
- Immersive science-dance events that communicate marine research through both cerebral and embodied forms

## Our Impact

Seanome is creating tangible breakthroughs across multiple domains:

- **Medicine**: Identifying marine proteins with potential to transform therapeutic approaches
- **Climate Solutions**: Understanding cellular adaptations that could inform environmental technologies
- **Agriculture**: Uncovering novel biological systems for sustainable food production
- **Scientific Infrastructure**: Building the computational foundation for the next generation of biodiversity research

## Current Projects

From arctic clams that tolerate neurotoxins to ancient marine animals with unique immune systems, we're exploring the frontier of molecular biodiversity:

- Identifying deeply conserved protein structures between ancient marine creatures and humans
- Characterizing proteins found only in rare human diseases and specific marine organisms
- Developing evolutionary analyses that detect structural homology at unprecedented evolutionary distances

## Join Our Journey

Whether you're a scientist, developer, naturalist, or simply ocean-curious, we invite you to join us in unlocking the genetic potential of our planet's greatest biodiversity repository.

- Follow our research journey
- Contribute to our open-source projects
- Participate in our community events
- Support our mission

Together, we'll transform marine genomics through accessible, collaborative technology that serves the forgotten 99% of ocean biodiversity, citizen scientists, and human ecological knowledge.
