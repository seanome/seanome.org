## Our Why

### Vision

> Our vision is to open-source the code of life, empowering humanity’s transformation to a world guided by nature’s ancient wisdom.

Imagine a world where cars are made of seashells, homes use tree- and coral-inspired materials to clean air and water, and we've eliminated disease because we understand nature has solved every molecular problem. We see a future where, given any problem, we ask how nature has already solved this problem? How has nature already solved this disease?

### Mission

> We build open tools to characterize the “forgotten 99%” of marine genetic diversity, unlocking breakthroughs to heal, nourish, and renew life on Earth.

Biodiversity brought us breakthroughs like [Ozempic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide) (derived from [lizard venom](https://medicine.uq.edu.au/article/2024/04/rise-ozempic-how-surprise-discoveries-and-lizard-venom-led-new-class-weight-loss-drugs)) and [anti-HIV and anti-cancer compounds](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/sea-sponge-hiv-medicine) from a [ancient sea sponges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectitethya_crypta) providing a glimpse of what’s possible when we start to dive into the ocean’s depths. These discoveries come from a handful of species representing a tiny fraction of Earth’s biodiversity. We’ve only begun to explore nature’s 4 billion years of experiments.

### Who we are 

Seanome is a nonprofit, focused research organization (FRO) building scalable, open-source tools to decode the vast genetic potential of our oceans. Founded by computational biologist Dr. Olga Botvinnik, we are revolutionizing how scientists understand and harness marine biodiversity.

## Why the Ocean?

The ocean is home to [~80% of animal life](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1711842115), animals with unique adaptations that can't exist on land, and has provided transformational technology (jellyfish's green fluorescent protein, GFP) essential for developing [COVID vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2639-4) or [cancer treatments](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4383682/). The extraordinary biodiversity has created fast-evolving immune systems to battle [100 million viruses](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-marine-120709-142805) per teaspoon of seawater. This ecosystem is nature's most diverse testing ground and offers a gold mine of novel therapeutics (including antivirals, antibiotics, antifungals) and an ideal environment for building better protein analysis tools. Decoding the ocean's molecular mysteries, we can understand anything.

## Why Ocean Animals?

Seanome focuses on ocean animals (rather than microbes) because of the emergent properties appearing in complex organ systems. Animal bodies are like cities, requiring municipal-wide waste management (lymphatic system), communication mechanisms (nervous system), and defense (immune system), while microbes are like single-family homes. At Seanome, we are especially interested in the [neuroimmune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimmune_system) axis because of the interplay between our nervous system and immune response. By studying animals with vastly different body plans than ourselves (octopuses, jellyfish, clams), we can learn deep biological truths about disease manifestation.

### An untapped trillion-dollar frontier

43 billion animal genes, yet we only understand what ~8000 of them do (see analysis at [seanome/2025-biodata-wealth-inequality](https://github.com/seanome/2025-biodata-wealth-inequality)). Of these, 13 FDA-approved drugs worth $8.4B have been identified, including [anti-HIV and anti-cancer compounds](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/sea-sponge-hiv-medicine) developed from naturally-occurring compounds discovered in an [ancient sea sponge (*Tectitethya crypta*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectitethya_crypta).

## Why Nonprofit?

We’re nonprofit and open-source to make science better for everyone. If we make products that only well-financed pharma companies can afford, we’re not expanding the opportunity space enough to transformationally change the world by democratizing access to innovation. Fundamentally, we need to build (and maintain!) open-source tools to enable the most innovation. We can make the tools that enable the most people to create all the patents, medicines, and materials the world needs from the quadrillions of unknown proteins in the world.
