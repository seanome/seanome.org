## Why the Ocean?

The ocean is home to [~80% of animal life](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1711842115), animals with unique adaptations that can't exist on land, and has provided transformational technology (jellyfish's green fluorescent protein, GFP) essential for developing [COVID vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2639-4) or [cancer treatments](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4383682/). The extraordinary biodiversity has created fast-evolving immune systems to battle [100 million viruses](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-marine-120709-142805) per teaspoon of seawater. This ecosystem is nature's most diverse testing ground and offers a gold mine of novel therapeutics (including antivirals, antibiotics, antifungals) and an ideal environment for building better protein analysis tools. Decoding the ocean's molecular mysteries, we can understand anything.

## Why Ocean Animals (not just microbes)?

*Microbes are single-family homes; animals are bustling cities.*

Seanome focuses on ocean animals (rather than microbes) because of the emergent properties in complex organ systems. Animal bodies are like cities, requiring municipal-wide waste management (lymphatic system), communication mechanisms (nervous system), and defense (immune system), while microbes are like single-family homes. Studying octopus brains, clam shells, and jellyfish neurons reveals *systems‑level* blueprints for regeneration, longevity, and materials science that single‑celled life alone can’t teach us.

### An untapped trillion-dollar frontier

43 billion animal genes, yet we only understand what ~8000 of them do (see analysis at [seanome/2025-biodata-wealth-inequality](https://github.com/seanome/2025-biodata-wealth-inequality)). Of these, 13 FDA-approved drugs worth $8.4B have been identified, including [anti-HIV and anti-cancer compounds](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/sea-sponge-hiv-medicine) developed from naturally-occurring compounds discovered in an [ancient sea sponge (*Tectitethya crypta*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectitethya_crypta).
