## Why the Ocean?

The ocean is home to [~80% of animal life](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1711842115), animals with unique adaptations that can't exist on land, and has provided transformational technology (jellyfish's green fluorescent protein, GFP) essential for developing [COVID vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2639-4) or [cancer treatments](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4383682/). The extraordinary biodiversity has created fast-evolving immune systems to battle [100 million viruses](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-marine-120709-142805) per teaspoon of seawater. This ecosystem is nature's most diverse testing ground and offers a gold mine of novel therapeutics (including antivirals, antibiotics, antifungals) and an ideal environment for building better protein analysis tools. Decoding the ocean's molecular mysteries, we can understand anything.

## Why Ocean Animals (not just microbes)?

*Microbes are single-family homes; animals are bustling cities.*

Seanome focuses on ocean animals (rather than microbes) because of the emergent properties in complex organ systems. Animal bodies are like cities, requiring municipal-wide waste management (lymphatic system), communication mechanisms (nervous system), and defense (immune system), while microbes are like single-family homes. Studying octopus brains, clam shells, and jellyfish neurons reveals *systems‑level* blueprints for regeneration, longevity, and materials science that single‑cell life can’t teach us.

### An untapped trillion-dollar frontier

43 billion animal genes, yet we only understand what ~8000 of them do (see analysis at [seanome/2025-biodata-wealth-inequality](https://github.com/seanome/2025-biodata-wealth-inequality)). Of these, 13 FDA-approved drugs worth $8.4B have been identified, including [anti-HIV and anti-cancer compounds](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/sea-sponge-hiv-medicine) developed from naturally-occurring compounds discovered in an [ancient sea sponge (*Tectitethya crypta*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectitethya_crypta).

## Why Nonprofit?

We’re nonprofit and open-source to make science better for everyone. If we make products that only well-financed pharma companies can afford, we’re not expanding the opportunity space enough to transformationally change the world by democratizing access to innovation. Fundamentally, we need to build (and maintain!) open-source tools to enable the most innovation. We can make the tools that enable the most people to create all the patents, medicines, and materials the world needs from the quadrillions of unknown proteins in the world.
